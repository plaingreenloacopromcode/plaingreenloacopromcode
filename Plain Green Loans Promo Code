Signature loans with no credit check are also offered in much smaller amounts than typical personal loans, the best of which may offer up to $50,000 or even higher, depending on the lender. For payday loans, you're usually limited to borrowing $500 or $1,000, although some lenders offer loans for up to $10,000.

Finally, signature loans with no credit check may require you to pay back the money in a much shorter time frame, such as within two weeks or a couple of months. In contrast, traditional personal lenders often let you pay a loan off in 24 to 84 months.
